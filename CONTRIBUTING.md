# Contribution

Hey there, thanks for the interest!
  
If you have suggestions to improve this list by adding new items or modifying existing ones, it would be my pleasure to do so.

### Suggestions format
All I ask is you to follow few rules :
1. No COVID-19 related stuff. We have enough of it all around us. This list is precisely existing to get away from it
2. Provide concrete examples
3. A short description is a very nice-to-have
4. A picture is cool but optional

### The quality

It has to be something you use (or have used recently) and you personally recommend.

Please don't suggest ideas you "have heard of but never tried".

### How to contribute

* Create a PR if you're familiar with GitHub or if you don't have a way to contact me personally
* Send me a message if you do :)

Stay safe and be strong!
