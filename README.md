## Quick word
Confinement is hard. For everyone. We're separated, we have to adapt,

using, watching and contributing to this amazing technology. For those who don't, this period is probably harder 
because it's unfamiliar to be locked at home.

The idea of this list is simple : it might not be something revolutionary, but it could be something
that leads us towards new discoveries, interests, or even new skills!
